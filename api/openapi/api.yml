        Used for selecting plugins. For example, a selector that provides the

          description: >-
            The client must have prior knowledge of the full list of selectors
            available for a given version of a mapper. So this unique selector id is used to
            determine which selector type is described. Stylistically, the id will
            end in the community standard coding system used for this type, e.g.,
            taxid.NCBI, but not always, e.g., FUSE:iHSA is a selector 
            for choosing analysis using the iHSA model on human organisms.

            If absent, all values are legal, so treat the value like a string.
            Use the JSON schema,
            https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html.
            For example, { type: 'string', 'enum': [ '9606', '10090' ]
            } to define an enumeration,  { 'type': 'number' } for a float, and {
            'type': 'number', 'minimum': '0' } for a positive number, and {
            'type': 'integer' } for an integer. Furthermore, a non-standard
            'title' can be added in support of a human-readable string for the
            type's value. This maybe be implemented by FUSE to aid in
            debugging, however clients should not depend on this value. NOTE:
            This value is actually an object type, but we use 'string' here to
            overcome a shortcoming of the swagger ui. This design choice was
            made in order to prioritize a better interactive documentation
            experience for the API user.
          example:
            type: string
            enum:
              - value: '9606'
                title: Human

            The title in the example is optional. NOTE: This value is actually an object type, but we use

          description: Human-readable name for this selector type.
    PluginParameter:
      type: object
      description: Used for specifying factory defaults, admin over-ride defaults,
        user-over-ride input values, and ultimately the values that the plugin
        will use, or reports as having used, to parameterize models.

          description: >-
            The id for one of the parameters used by the plugin in question.
            Parameters are completely defined by the plugin and need not be
            interchangable with other plugins. The client will have no prior
            knowledge for plugin parameters.
          example: 'FUSE:geneList'
        title:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A non-standardized, human-readable string to describe the id. May be
            implemented by FUSE to aid in debugging, clients should not

          example: >-
            Gene list specifying which genes to return
        parameterDescription:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A precise description of the parameter, provided by the plugin requiring
            the parameter. This description can be served by the client to guide the
            user in overriding default parameter values. Plugins should consider using
            a message catalog to hold parameterDescription strings in order to 
            facilitate internationalization.
          example: >-
            Please choose 'all' to return all genes, 'intersection' to return the intersection of all genes in the group of aliquots, or 'specific' to use a specific list of genes.

        those values, and/or user-supplied replacements for values missing in the original data source.
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The id for one of the object variables supported by this FUSE
            version. The api client (e.g., dashboard) has the option of ignoring any variable if the client
            doesn't recognize the id, but if another plugin requires this variable, 
            then the end user won't have the option of overriding that ignored variable.
            Stylistically, community standard coding system used for this type will 
            preface the code used, e.g., taxid:9606, HGNC:1000, LOINC:30525-0, etc.
          example: 'LOINC:30525-0'
        certitude:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The certitude of the value, 0 not certain, 1 somewhat certain, 2
            certain. User-supplied values will always be '2' to avoid personal 
            bias in reporting certitude, with the assumption that human error 
            will be intercepted, and human intelligence overrides algorithm outputs.
          example: 2
        variableDescription:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Description of the object variable can optionally be set by the plugin. Object
            variable descriptions should describe the variable precisely; for
            example, rather than say simply 'BMI',the variable might be
            described as 'nearest BMI prior to measurement', or
            'comma-delimited list of {BMI,date} objects for the object with a
            given study period, as defined by the 'study-start', 'study-end'
            model parameters'. The comprehensive list of supported object variables is tied to
            the FUSE release. 
          example: "The age is determined by subtracting the birthdate from the relative time. Also known as 'chronological age' or 'Post Natal Age' (PNA). Specified as some fraction of years, convention."
        how:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A value of 'The value was specified by the end user.' indicates
            that the data source value (whether or not it was missing in the data source)
            has been overriden by the end user.
          example: The value was specified by the end user.
        title:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A non-standardized, human-readable string to describe the object variable. May be
            implemented by FUSE to aid in debugging, clients should not
            depend on this value.
          example: Age
        variableValue:
          description: >-
            The type for the variableValue is defined by the legalValues, and thus is
            the client informed on how to render the variableValue. The
            variableValue may also include the 'units' field, which is optional,
            and if left off, implies the system default units. It's up to the
            analysis plugin to make unit conversions as needed by the analysis
            model, just as it is up to the dashboard to make unit conversions as
            needed by the end user. NOTE: The 'variableValue' is actually an object 
            type, but we use 'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of the swagger 
            ui. This design choice was made in order to prioritize a better 
            interactive documentation experience for the API user.
          type: object
          example:
            value: '0.5'
            units: years
        why:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Provides the client with a human-readable, non-standard
            justification for why the plugin needs this particular variable.
            This can be rendered by the client to provide the end-user with
            rationale for the object values, but does not address how the value
            was computed.
          example: >-
            Age is used to compare objects.
        legalValues:
          type: object
          description: >-
            If absent, all values are legal, so treat the value like a string.
            Use the JSON schema,
            https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html.
            For example, { type: 'string', 'enum': [  'all', 'intersection'  ]
            } to define an enumeration,  { 'type': 'number' } for a float, and {
            'type': 'number', 'minimum': '0' } for a positive number, and {
            'type': 'integer' } for an integer.
          example:
            type: number
            minimum: '0'
        group:
            type: string
            description: >-
              A 'tag' for grouping semantically similar variables. Used to inform
              the client on how to render many object variables. Otherwise superfluous and can be safely ignored by client if not helpful for rendering.
            example: "Sample"
        timestamp:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The time used to compute the object variable, for example, can be set to a time in the past to make predictions and compare to recent data.
          format: date-time
          example: "2020-07-01T14:29:15.453Z"
    Bundle:
      type: object
